    <Destination>This is the passion of one family. The building itself is designed and built by them and you are likely to meet the couple and their son. They collected the exhibits over many years. Wish they had a much larger place to display. 
Highly recommended    </Destination>

    <Destination>Amazing collection of ancient antiques. Some were as old as 3000 B.C. Three floored structure and each piece of its architecture is antique. Some key points for travellers 
1. Footwear not allowed. You have to keep your footwear in lockers outside. No charge for lockers. Guard is there. 
2. Entry fee - Rs 100 
3. Extra charge in case you want to take photographs. Very genuine amount. 
4. People who cannot stand the smell of wooden polish should avoid this place as majority of antiques are wooden and all are protected by polish.    </Destination>

    <Destination>This museum is a delight of "stuff" one man collected over 40 years. It is arranged on three floors and there is everything from treasure to junk. Huge wooden carvings of elephants and Hindu gods along side enormous unglazed pots for poking dead people into for burial. Top floor is a Kathakali dance threatre with beautiful painted panels on the ceiling. A pleasant hour was spent and it would be easy to spend twice as long    </Destination>

    <Destination>Visited in 2016 and so glad we did. 

The Fort Kochi area can seem a little too touristy at times, so it was lovely to be able to experience some of the local culture in this way. 

Situated at the southern end of Ernakulam and out of the city centre, we were told that the Folklore Museum is suffering from a lack of visitors. This is a real shame as it is no more than 15 mins by tuk tuk from the ferry port . Entry is Rs 200, with an extra 100 if you want to take photos (worthwhile to support the museum). 

The museum houses a private collection in a purpose-built structure, combining Malabar, colonial Portuguese and Keralan styles of architecture. The roof is intricately carved and weighs 63 tonnes - it has to be seen to be believed! 

The derth of items on show is incredible - large sculpture on the first floor, smaller items on the second and galleries packed full in between. There is also a collection of costumes for traditional dances which makes for great photos. 

The people working there really help to make a visit worthwhile. They are very friendly, and forthcoming with the history of the collection and of Kerala. Don't be afraid to ask anything! 

We stayed for almost 90 mins and had a great time. Combine a visit to the museum with a trip to one of the clothing stores for saris and fabric (we went to Kalyan Silks), and then lunch in The Grand (some of the best food we've had, and very inexpensive) and you can easily while away a whole morning.    </Destination>

    <Destination>This museum is jam packed with wonderful artifacts! In fact, the displays are over- crowded and each piece doesn't get the recognition it deserves. I suppose that can't be helped in a limited space. The museum is new but built with materials from demolished buildings. Air conditioning would be nice for the tourists who aren't accustomed to the oppressive Kerala heat and humidity, and would also help in the preservation of the museum pieces.    </Destination>

    <Destination>This museum surprised me to a great extent. This is not much promoted by the Kerala Tourism but it is surely one of the best places to visit in Kochi. It provides good information on Kerala Sculpture Arts, Architecture, Dances and other things. The wooden architecture and the paintings are awesome. I would recommend this place even for those people who do not like to visit the museum. If you are visiting Kochi, it should be in your bucket list.    </Destination>

    <Destination>I generally keep Museums lowest on my agenda as I get bore very quickly. However considering the rating and the fact that this hotel was mere 100mtr from my hotel (Keys), I decided to give it a visit. 
It has a very good collection of Keralite Antiques and the entire ambience keeps you engaged. 
Duration You'd need- ~45mins 
Crowded - No 
Fee - 100 per person + 100 extra for carrying digital camera 
Recommended - Yes.    </Destination>

    <Destination>This place is for some reason often forgotton amonst the sights to see in Kochi. We went there on a slow day and were quite blown away! The museum is a comprehensive treasure house of Keralan Folk Art through the ages, with just hundreds of beautiful pieces.

    <Destination>My visit to Folklore Museum was short but I enjoyed alot of the artwork. There's alot history and beautiful pieces. If you're bored and have time to kill then this is a place to check out. I wouldn't say it's a must-see spot.My only complaint is that the staff member who I purchased my ticket from was not so pleasant and that there's a fee to take photos. I understand the need to raise funds for this privately run museum but it's kinda silly to pay separately for taking photos when you already purchased an entrance ticket.    </Destination>

    <Destination>If you are in Cochin, this is one museum you should not miss. The highlight of this museum is that the museum in itself is a piece of art. Pillars, roofs, doors and windows from old palaces temples and houses have been effectively used in the construction of this museum. The museum houses an interesting array of artifacts relating to lifestyle, religion, language, music, dance and rituals. 
This museum houses some really fine examples of Tanjavore glass paintings and some really cool mural paintings. A lot of effort has been put into making this a fantastic museum    </Destination>

    <Destination>JAN 20th, 2016 is most memorable day in my life since I was able to visit magnificent art gallery called "FOLKLORE" museum unexpectedly since it was next to my Hotel KEYS. I am always fascinate about the ancient ethnic artifacts, History and culture etc..In fact my entire Kerala tour would not have completed 100 percent if I could not have visited this gallery. 

It was founded by Mr George Thaliath and his wife Annie. I should really appreciate their great interest, efforts and dedication in collecting, organizing and displaying magnificent antiquities. 

The museum covers all varieties of artifacts related to ancient social, culture, art etc   mind-blowing collection and skillful display 

Above all FOLKLORE theatre located in the second floor is the key attraction.

I sincerely recommend to all travelers visiting Cochin to visit this place and encourage the family of Mr Goerge family. 

Hats off to Mr Goerge and Ms Annie  if at all I get a chance to visit Cochin again and I shall certanely visit this place.    </Destination>

    <Destination>This was an amazing find on the outskirts of Kochi. The ground floor is full of statues and a little dark but as you climb to the upper floors the exhibits are stunning especially the costumes and puppets. The small shop is also worth a visit, I bought some lovely rosewood book marks. The staff are extremely helpful too and anxious that more visitors find it, hence this review.    </Destination>

    <Destination>This musuem is just 10 minutes away from Ernakulam Railway station. Its beautiful wooden architecture arrests your attention from a distance. The museum has artifacts covering three floors and is a must visit if you are interested in history. The artifacts include statues of Gods, Goddesses, their vaahanas etc. dating some centuries back. There are portraits of royal men and women of Kerala.Taking pictures is allowed, so you may click photographs of manuscripts and seals etc. These would come handy while explaining history lessons to your children. The storage of artifacts seems to be an issue and one has to move carefully to avoid bumping into them.    </Destination>

Very varied with something for everyone...art sculptures, cutlasses and weapons, puppets, puppets, business, jewellery, painting, architecture. 

Amazing building composed of parts of 40 different Keralan buildings. I was lucky to be shown around by Jacob - a member of the family that owns this private museum. 

They needed sponsorship to keep it open so PLEASE GO AND SUPPORT THIS FANTASTIC MUSEUM.    </Destination>

    <Destination>We did not know this museum. Walking through the fist room and moving up through the floors, one begins to wonder how one person, one family had the will and foresight to construct such a thing of beauty, not just for Keralans but for the world. Masses of artefacts, deeply moving displays of everyday life and rituals, as well as folklore. Every corner resonated with history, and a sort of magic, when surrounded by so much thoughtfully displayed beauty. We were completely awestruck, and could not quite believe that the museum is run with no state or federal support at all - it literally is a labour of love, and a testament to the depth and breadth of South Indian cultural and religious life - of course, not just Hinduism, but the important place that Christianity has also occupied in the last few hundred years. A brilliant and bold statement, in a troubled world, of how important co-existence is and how beautiful it can be.    </Destination>

    <Destination>This place has been certified by limca book of records for gathering more cultural artifacts about the Kerala history and its worth the visit. Once you reach to the museum you will be greeted with traditional Kerala welcome with "tikka" on forehead. This is located in new wooden building constructed and all possible collection which talks about the Kerala history has been placed here. This has the entrance fee of 100 per head (Indian nationals) and if you want to the use the camera then per camera 100 rupees. Once you enter there are very old (few are 300 years old 1300 BC time frame terracotta articles) artifacts and idols are neatly placed and you can see them. It has two floors for different art culture and on second floor you see the different folk dance (kathakalli and other) dance attires are placed and it has the perfect lighting conditions to see them clearly. 
They opened shops for handicrafts and other wooden artifacts but I would recommend not purchasing since they quoted very exuberantly. It's worth visit once and not to miss visiting this place.    </Destination>

    <Destination>Kochi is amazingly dirty, smelly and fouled with litter and rats. There are good hotels and lovely people, but the pollution is awful and there are very few things to do unless you can turn a blind eye to beaches and walks covered in rotting rubbish and waste plastic. 

The folklore museum, though, is superb. A taxi ride out of the main town, it's a fantastic old building stuffed with interesting artefacts. It made us realise that Kerala has a proud, colourful and fascinating past that isn't evident in the chaos and grime of everyday city life.    </Destination>

    <Destination>The Folklore Museum is literally crammed with exhibits. There is so much to see! Sadly it seems to be under threat due to a high tax bill it can't pay.

    <Destination>This folklore museum is absolutely beautiful. The interior is all dark wood, and it houses lots of Indian heritage that just should not be lost. We were very disappointed when we went there to find out that they are having to sell off some of their artefacts to meet debts and that the government may have to close The museum to repay the debt. You can see how much the staff here love the museum and rightly so. So do you go while you can and hopefully visitors can prevent it being closed down.    </Destination>

    <Destination>Great museum. I understood from staff this was a private museum that has been collecting and preserving local history and local artifacts. Part of funding comes from admittance fee but also from the sale of many items in the museum from antique items to newly made local crafts. This is a must see in Cochin with staff willing to answer questions. Make the trip you will be surprised!    </Destination>

    <Destination>Wonderful collection of ancient artifacts dating back to the 600/700 AD through to the late 19th century. The whole of Kerala and its ancient customs is housed under this one roof. I thoroughly enjoyed the all the floors and the string puppet theater. They also had for sale of of the collection of less importance and of not great value, we purchased 3 items from here. The money raised form the sale of these items goes into maintaining the museum and the important larger artifacts. A must visit place if you are into museums and ancient history.    </Destination>

    <Destination>Kerala folklore theatre and museum is a different and must see place in kochi. It has a collection of artifacts which reflects Indian history and culture. It has a huge collection of idols, frames and other items of historical importance. The top floor of the museum is very unique. The top floor is made completely of tonnes of wood and has no concrete slabs/pillars. The ceiling, flooring and walls are made of wood. The top floor is used as theatre. 

I found the entry fees of Rs 100/- a little on the higher side for a museum.

    <Destination>I had been to this museum on 1st Dec 2015. This is a three story structure made of wood which reminded me of Tibetan architecture. The museum is a treasure of 17th and 18th century artifacts from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala region. There are lot of stone sculptures from the Chola Dynasty. I could also see earthern pots which are 3000 yrs old. There is also good collection of dresses and ornaments of 17th century as well as various weapons used by the kings and the soldiers. The top floor is unique which has a big hall with no pillar support..an engineering marvel.The entry fee is Rs 100/ per head and Rs 100/ for camera.Must see in Kochi.    </Destination>

    <Destination>The folk museum is a little out of the way but is an unmissable experience. Housed in a traditional 4 storey traditional wooden building the collection represents many years of private collecting. The rooms are literally stuffed with cultural and historical artefacts. Costumes and masks are particularly well represented. Each room on each floor is an aladdin's cave of objects d'art. Less stuffy than a public museum the collection provides an intimate exhibition of a huge number of items collected and documented over many years. The top floor provides a stage and finely decorated auditorium. It deservedly has the reputation as being one of the best museums in India. Entrance is 200R photography 100R.    </Destination>

    <Destination>The museum is spread across 3 floors with very interesting and rare artefacts. I found the top most floor interesting as it explained the mudras and the styles of Kerala-origin dances. 

If you are a history buff, you will spend at least 3 hours.    </Destination>

    <Destination>This museum is a great place to view a collection of cultural and historical artefacts from southern India particularly from Kerala. You have to pay an extra fee to photograph the exhibits. The whole building is made of stone and wood with intricate carvings and wooden staircases. The exhibits range from statues of mythological beings, dance and musical instruments and costumes to everyday objects and weapons. Getting a guide with you is recommended as the information given for some of the exhibits is sparse.    </Destination>
